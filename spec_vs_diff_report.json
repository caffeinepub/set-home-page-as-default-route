  "summary": "Both REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear to be implemented in TeamMembersPage.tsx. The diff summary describes glassmorphic portrait frames with backdrop-blur, layered gradient backgrounds, neon-colored glowing borders, corner accent dots, scan-line shimmer overlay, frosted name overlay, and CSS brightness/contrast/saturation enhancements — matching the acceptance criteria for both requirements. The carousel navigation and auto-advance logic are preserved.",
