      "text": "Redesign both team member profile images in TeamMembersPage.tsx to use a glassmorphic frame: apply a frosted-glass card effect (backdrop-blur, semi-transparent background, subtle border with white/light opacity) around each member's photo, ensuring the image is displayed at a consistent and suitable size (e.g., 200×200px or similar square dimensions) with rounded corners and a soft glowing border to match the existing dark futuristic glassmorphism theme.",
