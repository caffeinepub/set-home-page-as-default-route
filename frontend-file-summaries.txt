{
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Main application component with TanStack Router configuration defining routes for all pages. The root `/` route sets an `appSession` flag in sessionStorage and renders LoginPage; the `/admin` route now requires this session flag (redirecting to `/` if missing), ensuring the login page always opens first on a fresh browser session.",
  "frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx": "Deleted — replaced by LoginPage at the root route; this file is no longer needed.",
  "frontend/src/pages/ProjectDetailsPage.tsx": "Project details page displaying a grid of project cards with status badges, team information, and deadlines.",
  "frontend/src/components/Header.tsx": "Sticky header component with navigation links, logo, and active route highlighting.",
  "frontend/src/components/Footer.tsx": "Footer component with brand information, quick links, social media icons, and Caffeine attribution with UTM tracking.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "React Query hooks for all backend operations; `useGetVisitorLog` now throws an error when the backend returns null (wrong password) so the query enters error state rather than silently showing an empty list, ensuring the UI correctly reflects authentication failures.",
  "frontend/src/index.css": "Global styles with OKLCH color system for light and dark modes using CSS custom properties.",
  "frontend/src/pages/AdminPanel.tsx": "Password-protected admin panel with a visitor log that correctly distinguishes between loading/error/empty/populated states, displays each visitor's username and formatted timestamp in a card list, with Refresh and Clear All buttons, plus a live Recent Activity section.",
  "frontend/src/pages/TeamMembersPage.tsx": "Team members carousel page with redesigned glassmorphic portrait frames (200×240px) featuring backdrop-blur, layered gradient backgrounds, neon-colored glowing borders, corner accent dots, scan-line shimmer overlay, frosted name overlay at the bottom, and CSS brightness/contrast/saturation enhancements on the images — all carousel navigation and auto-advance logic preserved.",
  "frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx": "Login page with typewriter animation that stores the username in sessionStorage immediately on submit, awaits the `logVisitor` backend mutation to record the visitor's name, then navigates to the host page — with empty/whitespace validation and a loading spinner during the log call.",
  "frontend/src/pages/HostDetailsPage.tsx": "Host profile page for Naveen V featuring a glassmorphic portrait card (220×290px) with backdrop-blur, neon cyan border, frosted bottom overlay with name/role, scan-line animation, and corner accent dots — using the new enhanced photo at `/assets/generated/naveen-profile.dim_600x800.png` — alongside bio, quick stats, technical skills, and areas of interest sections."
