# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Redesign the team member profile image cards in TeamMembersPage.tsx with glassmorphic styling and CSS-level visual enhancements.

**Planned changes:**
- Wrap each team member's photo in a glassmorphic frame using backdrop-blur, semi-transparent background, and a subtle glowing/frosted border consistent with the dark futuristic theme
- Display profile images at a consistent square size (e.g., 200×200px) with rounded corners, avoiding stretching or awkward cropping
- Apply CSS enhancements to the images (brightness boost, contrast increase, subtle inner glow or drop-shadow) to make photos appear more vibrant and polished
- Apply the same glassmorphic styling to the fallback initials avatar
- Ensure the carousel layout remains functional and responsive after the redesign

**User-visible outcome:** Both team member profile photos (Naveen V and Saarumathi A) appear in polished glassmorphic frames with consistent sizing, rounded corners, glowing borders, and visually enhanced (brighter, higher contrast) photos that fit the dark futuristic theme.
