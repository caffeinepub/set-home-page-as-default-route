# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Configure the application to display the home page as the default route when users first open the application.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the routing configuration to set the home page as the default route at the application root URL
- Ensure the project page remains accessible via its specific route path

**User-visible outcome:** When users open the application, they will see the home page first instead of the project page. Navigation between pages continues to work as expected.
